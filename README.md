# Monolite for JetBrains IDEs

This JetBrains version of the [Monolite theme](https://github.com/baukeposthuma/monolite) is created automatically with the [JetBrains color scheme tool](https://github.com/JetBrains/colorSchemeTool/).

In addition I've added a few tweaks to make the warnings more visible.

## Installation

1. Download the .icls file.
2. Open Preferences > Editor > Color scheme and click the small cog beside the active editor theme.
3. Choose Import Scheme and locate the .icls file.
